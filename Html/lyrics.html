            <span style="background-color: beige;">I remember the ocean, memories die out so hard</span>
            We were travelling the mountains,<b> just to find the loudest seas</b> 
            We settled down by the fire,<i>knowing we could aim higher</i> 
            <u>But we didn't know that yet</u>

            So, if you want something to hold on to, gotta find it first,<big>but here I am</big> 
            'Cause, I've been laying under palm trees, waiting for the summer
            Knowing there's nowhere to go
            'Cause I am happy on this Island, wanna be my funland?
            I don't ever want to leave
            I'm in a tropic love
            <del>I'm in a tropic love</del>
