            <dt>Barbell Squat</dt>
            <dd>A barbell squat is a fundamental compound exercise primarily targeting the muscles of the legs and lower back. It involves positioning a barbell across the upper back and shoulders while standing with feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider. Keeping the chest up and the core engaged, the lifter begins the movement by bending at the knees and hips, lowering the body down until the thighs are parallel to the ground or as far as comfortably possible. The movement is then reversed, driving through the heels to lift the weight back to the starting position, fully extending the hips and knees. </dd>
